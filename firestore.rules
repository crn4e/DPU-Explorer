/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.
 * Access is dictated by roles defined in dedicated collections: `/admins` for developers
 * with full control, and `/announcementAdmins` for users who can only manage announcements.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is structured around a central '/locations' collection.
 * Each location document can contain '/announcements' and '/images' subcollections.
 * A top-level '/openingHours' collection is linked to locations.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read-Only Access: All primary data collections ('/locations', '/openingHours',
 *   and their subcollections) are publicly readable to support the app's function
 *   as a campus explorer.
 * - Granular Write Controls:
 *   - Developers (`isAdmin()`): Have full CUD (Create, Update, Delete) access to all data.
 *   - Announcement Admins (`isAnnouncementAdmin()`): Can only update the `announcement` field
 *     on existing `locations` documents. They cannot create, delete, or modify other fields.
 * - Role List Protection: The lists of administrators are not publicly readable, except by other admins.
